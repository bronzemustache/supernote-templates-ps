% This postscript file, in combination with the gs2 script which
% should also be in this directory, create a Supernote template of a
% 5mm dot grid.  The difference between this image and the 5mm grid
% template that ships with the Supernote is that the dots are slightly
% bigger and are therefore easier to see.

% Supernote templates can be 1404 x 1872 pixel png images, on both the
% a5x and a6x.  Everyting is the same, except that absolute distances
% like 5mm are a different number of pixels on the a5x versus a6x.

% Both a5x and a6x have 1872 x 1404 pixels.
