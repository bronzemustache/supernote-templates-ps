% This postscript file, in combination with the gs2 script which
% should also be in this directory, create a Supernote template of a
% 5mm dot grid.  The difference between this image and the 5mm grid
% template that ships with the Supernote is that the dots are slightly
% bigger and are therefore easier to see.

% Supernote templates can be 1404 x 1872 pixel png images.
