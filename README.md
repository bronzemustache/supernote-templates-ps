# Supernote Templates with Postscript

This repo contains examples of Postscript programs that generate [Supernote templates](https://supernote-templates.mostlyuseful.tech).

If you have an idea for a template that you'd like to implement in Postscript, reach out to me and I'll try and help you with that.  This is a weird thing to say, but I wrote Postscript professionally for almost ten years way back in the 90's.  It's an esoteric skill and while I don't think I could get a job doing it now, I have a lot of years on it and I wouldn't mind a reason to refresh.

## Prerequisites

To generate these templates you need Ghostscript and make.

## make Targets

Make all the templates:

`$ make all`

Make one template:

`$ make templates/5mm_dotgrid.png`
